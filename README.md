This project is my second attempt at a portfolio/ personal website. My first website lacked a certain pizzazz that I wanted it to. My current idea for this attempt is to feature a number of info boxes, such as Bio/ Experience/ Hobbies/ etc, in addition to fun widgets that allow me to learn new features and various js libraries. 

5/6 It's still in early stages of development, but its fun so far!
